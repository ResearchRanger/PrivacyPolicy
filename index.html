	The focus is on word recognition practice for beginning readers. Some of the words are expected to be known prior to kindergarten entry, others are more advanced. There are also some sight words. There is a short reading exercise (text passage) for each word. In each passage the featured word is displayed in a distinctive color. <span class="distinctColor">Featured Words:</span> 
				
		<div id="FeaturedWords" style="width:300px;clear:both;border-style: solid;border-width:1px;border-color:black;margin:10px auto">
